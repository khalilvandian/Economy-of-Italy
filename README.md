# Economic Data Visualization Project

## Introduction

This repository contains a data visualization project focusing on the Italian economy. The project utilizes recent economic data to construct insightful visualizations that shed light on crucial aspects of the Italian economy. Leveraging multiple statistical sources, it graphs trends over time, comparisons across sectors, and regional disparities related to household incomes, expenditure patterns, employee compensation, and disposable earnings. The graphical analysis aims to highlight noteworthy narratives in the data through effective data representation techniques that transform complex quantitative information into visually intuitive and easy-to-grasp graphs.

## Data Sources

The economic situation of Italy and its population can be analyzed from different perspectives, such as the income, expenditure, and compensation of the households and the employees. In this project, we utilize six sources of data to explore these aspects and compare them with other regions. The sources are:

1. **Compensation of employees breakdown by industry**: Data on the compensation of employees and its components by industry in Italy from 2016 to 2022. It includes wages and salaries, employersâ€™ social contributions, and taxes and subsidies on production and imports.

2. **Average Wage Italy**: Average annual wage in Italy from 2000 to 2022 in euros.

3. **Italian Monetary Value Coeff**: Tables of coefficients for converting monetary values of different years from 1861 to 2022 into values of a reference year. It allows us to compare the purchasing power of money over time and adjust for inflation.

4. **Italian Household Expenditure by Category**: Distribution of household expenditure in Italy by category in 2020.

5. **Disposable Income of Household By Region**: This link presents the disposable income of the households in the Italian regions from 2016 to 2022.

6. **Disposable Income Per Person**: Disposable income per person across European countries in 2022.
